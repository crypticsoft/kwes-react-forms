# Installation

## HTML Installation
Install the script tag (preferrably in the `<head>` of the document):
```
<script type="module" src="./dist/index.js" />
```

Then, add the following HTML tag where you want the form to be displayed:
```
    <div
        data-id="L6C4A1tTGJgxfefI6vtX"
        data-location="dist/form09.json"
    ></div>
```
Please note: You will replace the `data-id` attribute with your Kwesforms form ID.
The JSON endpoint `data-location` will also need to be updated.
